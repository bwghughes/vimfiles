# This is my vim setup. Just do:

ln -s /path/to/vim ~/.vim
ln -s /path/to/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

# I'm using pathogen to keep all my vim plugins in separate directories,
# and git submodules to manage both pathogen itself and all the plugins.
#
# That means I have a single git repo to clone to get a full vim setup.
